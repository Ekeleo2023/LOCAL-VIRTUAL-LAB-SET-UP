# LOCAL-VIRTUAL-LAB-SET-UP
Setting up a local virtual lab for cybersecurity.
Welcome to the Virtual Cybersecurity Lab project! 
 This guide helps you set up a complete virtual environment using VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2, Parrot Security OS, and Ubuntu Server, all safely isolated from your main system where you can: 

Practice penetration testing 

Perform network scanning 

Simulate real-world attacks 

Build and defend servers 

So that no physical hardware is harmed, everything runs virtually inside your host machine.
